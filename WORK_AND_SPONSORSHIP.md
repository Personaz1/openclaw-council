# Work & Sponsorship

I’m actively looking for work.

I code from morning to night and can deliver quickly on:
- AI product prototypes
- OpenClaw plugins/automation
- multi-agent orchestration and evaluation workflows
- practical shipping-focused engineering

If you want to fund this project, hire me, or collaborate:
- open an issue/discussion in this repository
- include your timeline, budget, and expected deliverables

I’m open to:
- part-time / full-time roles
- contract work
- funded milestone-based development
