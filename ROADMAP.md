# Roadmap

OpenClaw Council is functional and publicly released, but progress is currently constrained by limited funding for API usage and benchmark infrastructure.

## Current status

- ✅ v0.3.0 released
- ✅ Installable OpenClaw plugin overlay
- ✅ Native `/council` commands (`run`, `status`, `config-check`, `roles list`)
- ✅ Offline/mock-friendly development flow

## Funding reality

This project can continue in maintenance mode without funding.

However, **major quality jumps** (live multi-provider evaluation, robust benchmark suites, production observability) require funded API usage and contributor time.

## Planned milestones

### v0.4.0 — Usability and DX
- `/council run --file <prompt.md>`
- Better run artifact management
- Cleaner error diagnostics for provider failures

### v0.5.0 — Quality and Evaluation
- API-backed benchmark suite (golden prompts)
- Cross-provider comparison reports
- Confidence calibration improvements

### v0.6.0 — Team/Production Readiness
- Config profiles for different workloads
- CI test matrix for plugin command flows
- Optional telemetry hooks (privacy-safe)

## Collaboration / sponsorship

If you want to sponsor or collaborate:
- GitHub Issues/Discussions on this repo
- Open to funded feature work, implementation support, and custom role packs
